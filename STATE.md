=== STATE BLOCK — GOALS, ACHIEVEMENTS, BLIND SPOTS ===
Date: 2026-07-30
Status: Working prototype. Core file format (Set List names + params +
        instrument-name cross-reference) is reverse-engineered and wired
        into a real CHOC app with drag-and-drop open, dual-pane browse/
        filter/swap/copy, and an editable Comment field. About to become a
        git repo (no commits yet as of this writing) -- this file is
        written to be a clean starting point for that, not a session log.

--- GOAL ---

A cross-platform, cross-architecture editor for Korg Kronos `.PCG`/`.SNG`
backup files, built on CHOC (HTML/JS/CSS UI + native C++ bridge) -- same
stack choice as the sibling DIY-MIDI-METRONOME/EDITOR project, reused
rather than reinvented (same CMakeLists.txt structure, vendored
third_party/choc, fetchResource/bind wiring in main.cpp). Preferred
implementation language: C++.

First iteration scope, as originally given:
  1. Open a file, extract its Set List(s) to memory.
  2. Show all entries of the selected Set List; filter/search, copy/swap
     entries via drag and drop.
  3. A Norton-Commander-style dual pane to move/copy entries between
     Set Lists.

A sibling reference project (a running CHOC-based app + CI pipeline) was
mentioned early on as something the project owner would link in later for
conventions; not linked yet -- see Blind Spots.

--- THE FILE FORMAT (reverse-engineered; full byte-level detail in README.md) ---

The `.PCG`/`.SNG` container is chunked (RIFF/IFF-like, but big-endian, and
every chunk header is preceded by one still-unexplained 4-byte field).
`PCG1` (the whole file) has these top-level children:

  DIV1  -- small fixed table, not decoded
  SLS1  -- Set Lists (see below)
  PRG1  -- Programs: 20 sub-banks (MBK1/PBK1 tags, interleaved)
  CMB1  -- Combis: 14 sub-banks (CBK1 tags)
  DKT1  -- Drum Kits -- NOT explored
  WSQ1  -- Wave Sequences -- NOT explored
  GLB1  -- Global settings -- NOT explored
  DPI1  -- unidentified -- NOT explored

Set List names (`SLS1 > SLD1 > SDB1`): one `SDB1` chunk holds all 128 of
the unit's Set Lists. Header (count/numSetlists=128/bytesPerSetlist=3612)
followed by 128 blocks of 129 28-byte records each (1 name + 128 songs).
Record = `[4-byte marker][24-byte ASCII name]`. A marker value of
`28 0f 01 00` on the record right after a name flags "this is where the
128 songs start" -- names and markers otherwise look identical, so this is
the only way to find a Set List's boundary. Verified end to end: all 128
Set Lists extract correctly, including 5 real user-named ones with real
song titles.

Per-slot parameters (`SLS1 > STL1 > SBK1`, a sibling of SLD1 found only by
a *generic* chunk-tag scan, not a targeted SDB1-only search): same header
shape, 128 Set List blocks of a 40-byte header + 128 song records on a
542-byte stride. Confirmed record layout (all field offsets relative to
record start):

  +12  `4*(color-1) + type` -- type bit0 (1=Program, 0=Combi), color 1-based
  +13  bank index
  +14  program/combi number within that bank
  +15  Hold Time + 1
  +16  Volume, 0-127, no transform
  +18  Comment (free ASCII text, can contain literal \r\n, NUL-terminated;
       one still-unexplained reserved byte at +17 separates it from Volume)

Instrument-name cross-reference (`CMB1 > CBK1` for Combi, `PRG1 > MBK1`/
`PBK1` for Program): both use one shared record shape -- the same 12-byte
header again, then fixed-size records each starting with a 24-byte name
field 4 bytes in (space/NUL-padded, NOT NUL-terminated -- a full 24-char
name has no terminator at all). A slot's bank/number index directly into
`[bank][number]` of whichever list matches its type. Verified against
three independent ground-truth anchors the project owner gave directly
(not guessed): "Rolling in the Deep" (Combi, bank 7 = USER-A / record 9),
"Berlin Grand SW2 U.C." and "Rain Again" (Program, bank 0, records 0 and
127) -- all three matched exactly. Bank values outside the stored range
(>=20 for Program, >=14 for Combi) are real gaps, not bugs -- near-certainly
GM/GM2 references (fixed MIDI-spec content, not stored per-file); a
one-off bank-231/192 reference each looks like genuine data corruption in
that one slot rather than a parsing issue. Across a full real-ish test
file, 143/152 assigned slots resolved to a name; all 9 misses were
out-of-range, zero were in-range failures.

Deliberately NOT solved (see Blind Spots): Font size, Transpose, the
`used`/count header field's meaning, the reserved byte at SBK1 record +17,
the 4-byte chunk-header prefix field, and exactly which of the 20 PRG1
banks maps to which *display label* (the name lookup mechanism itself is
confirmed; the specific letter shown per bank index is a positional
assumption modeled on the project owner's given naming order, not
independently verified the way Combi's order was).

--- WHAT'S BUILT AND WORKING ---

  - `src/kronos/PcgFile.{h,cpp}`: parses SDB1 (names), SBK1 (Program/Combi/
    bank/number/Color/Hold Time/Volume/Comment per song), and CBK1/MBK1/
    PBK1 (real instrument names, cross-referenced into `Song::instrumentName`)
    per the layout above. `load(path)` and `loadFromMemory(bytes)` share
    one parsing path. Every optional chunk degrades gracefully (a file
    missing/mismatching SBK1 or the instrument banks still gets Set List
    names fine, just with emptier fields) rather than failing the whole load.
  - `src/bridge/EditorBridge.{h,cpp}`: holds loaded files keyed by a "pane"
    id ("A"/"B"). Exposes `openFile`(path, unused by the UI but kept for
    CLI/debug)/`openFileBytes`(base64, what the UI actually uses)/
    `listSetlists`/`getEntries`/`moveEntry`(swap within a Set List)/
    `copyEntry`(across panes/Set Lists, whole Song incl. all params)/
    `setComment`. Nothing is ever written back to disk -- everything is
    in-memory rearrangement only.
  - `frontend/`: two side-by-side panes (`pane.js`, one instance per side).
    Each pane is a drag-and-drop target (drop a `.PCG` file -> read via the
    browser's File API -> base64 -> `openFileBytes`; confirmed working by
    the project owner in the real app) with a Set List picker, filter/
    search, and a table of that Set List's 128 song slots showing Kronos's
    own 000-127 numbering, Type/Bank/Vol/Hold/Color columns, and the real
    instrument name as a subtitle under the slot's own label (shown
    always, even when identical to the label -- confirms the lookup found
    something). Dragging a row within a pane swaps two songs (all fields);
    dragging to a different pane/Set List copies the whole song across.
    Clicking a row expands an inline multiline Comment editor (monospace,
    grows to fit content past 10 rows, multiple rows can stay open at
    once); Apply calls `setComment`. No typed-path/Open-button UI (removed
    per explicit request -- drag-and-drop is the only way in, though the
    bridge's path-based `openFile` still exists underneath).
  - `frontend/mock_bridge.js`: fake in-memory backend (mirrors the real
    API) so the UI can be exercised in a plain browser with no native
    build -- cannot exercise real file parsing (browsers have no
    filesystem access at all, which is the whole reason Choc's native
    bridge exists).
  - Why drag-and-drop is the *only* open mechanism: a plain
    `<input type="file">` does trigger a real native NSOpenPanel inside the
    Choc-wrapped WKWebView, but the resulting sheet renders behind the app
    window instead of in front (a choc/WKWebView z-order quirk, root cause
    not isolated). Drag-and-drop sidesteps it entirely and is arguably the
    better design regardless -- it works identically on every platform,
    whereas recovering an absolute path from a WebView's file picker is
    inconsistent-to-impossible across WebKit/GTK-WebKit/WebView2. Tradeoff:
    base64-encoding a 50-70MB file in JS and shipping it through the
    bridge as one JSON string isn't fast -- fine for occasional loads, not
    a "reload on every drop" workflow.
  - Build: CMake, C++17, Debug (frontend/ read live off disk) vs Release
    (embedded via tools/embed_resources.py) split, mirroring
    DIY-MIDI-METRONOME/EDITOR's setup exactly. No MIDI/audio deps (no
    rtmidi) -- this tool only reads local files, no device I/O.

--- BLIND SPOTS / NOT YET TOUCHED ---

Format:
  1. Font size and Transpose encodings in an SBK1 record -- tested with
     real values but neither fits a clean pattern yet. Needs another
     targeted test file with a wider/cleaner value spread.
  2. What the `used`/count header field (present in SDB1/SBK1/CBK1/MBK1/
     PBK1 alike) actually counts.
  3. The reserved byte at SBK1 record offset +17.
  4. The 4-byte prefix field preceding every chunk header throughout the
     whole format.
  5. Exactly which of the 20 PRG1 banks maps to which display label --
     lookup mechanism confirmed, specific label-per-index is not.
  6. DKT1 (Drum Kits), WSQ1 (Wave Sequences), GLB1, DPI1 -- entirely
     unexplored. Unknown whether Set List slots can reference these
     directly (if so, instrument-name lookup has a gap there too).
  7. The older SoundQuest `.SQS` backup dialect (`LIST`/`FORM`/`BANK`
     wrapping) found under `~/Documents/Sound Quest/` -- structurally
     different from the `KORG`/`PCG1` dialect this parser targets; never
     tested against it.

App/UI:
  8. Leading spaces reportedly disappearing from Comment text somewhere in
     the round-trip -- reported once, not yet reproduced. Neither
     `readComment()` nor `setComment()` does any trimming, so the cause
     isn't obvious from code inspection alone; repro steps needed (typed
     fresh via Apply vs. already present in the source file).
  9. No save-back-to-file at all -- every edit (move/copy/comment) is
     memory-only and lost on reopen. This is the single biggest gap
     between "browser" and "editor."
  10. Filter/search and row drag-swap/drag-copy interactions have been
      exercised by the project owner in the real app for file-open and
      name-lookup verification, but not explicitly confirmed end-to-end
      for the swap/copy drag gestures themselves or the Set List picker
      dropdown -- worth a deliberate pass.
  11. NSOpenPanel-behind-the-window bug (see above) -- not blocking since
      drag-and-drop covers real usage, but unresolved if ever revisited.
  12. The sibling reference CHOC project (conventions, CI pipeline) still
      not linked in -- this scaffold's choices (no Bootstrap, plain CSS,
      specific file-open pattern) may get reconciled once it is.
  13. No CI pipeline of any kind yet.
  14. No automated test suite -- all verification so far has been ad hoc
      standalone smoke-test binaries compiled during investigation, not
      committed/repeatable tests.
